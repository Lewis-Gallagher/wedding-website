                Do we have to stay at the same hotel as the wedding venue?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>No. You are welcome to stay where ever you wish. We will supply all inclusive day passes for everyone for the wedding day only. Additional day passes before or after the wedding day can be purchased for â‚¬80 from the hotel.</p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li id="faq-2" style="font-weight:bold">
                Is there a wedding gift registry?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>We recognise that comming all this way for our wedding day is a lot to ask, so gifts are not expected. Your presence is present enough.</p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li id="faq-3" style="font-weight:bold">
                What's the dress code?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>Semi-formal beach wedding attire. For men, trousers and an open collar button-down shirt. Jackets and waist coats are optional but you may forgo the tie. Shoes can be close-toe loafers or something equally semi-formal.  For women, tea and maxi length dresses with dressy sandals. The wedding ceremony is taking place on the beach, so keep that in mind when choosing footwear.</p>
                <p>We expect the temperature to be 25-28 degrees, so please dress with this in mind.  We recommend light fabrics, for men wearing jackets in particular, such as linen and cotton.</p>
            </ul>

            <li id="faq-4" style="font-weight:bold">
                Can I change my RSVP?

                Can you recommend any nearby hotels?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>There are numerous other hotels and resorts between the Atlantica Beach Resort and the nearby town of Kardamaina. The closest is the Atlantica Belvedere Resort or the Porto Bello Royal. Alternatively, Kardamaina will have plenty of smaller hotels and bed and breakfasts available.</p>
            </ul>

            <li id="faq-6" style="font-weight:bold">
                When should I arrive/leave?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>Niki and I will be at the Atlantica Beach Resort from May 28th to June 4th. You are welcome to arrive and leave whenever suits you.</p>
            </ul>

            <li id="faq-7" style="font-weight:bold">
                Will there be a pre-wedding event?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <p>We do not have anything booked currently. However, we are looking to host a cocktail evening the night before the wedding to welcome everybody.</p>
