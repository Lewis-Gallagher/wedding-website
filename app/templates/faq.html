                No. You are welcome to stay where ever you wish. We will supply all inclusive day passes (10:00am-midnight) for everyone for the wedding day only. Additional day passes before or after the wedding day can be purchased for â‚¬80 from the hotel.

            <ul>
                We recognise that comming all this way for our wedding day is a lot to ask, so gifts are not expected.
