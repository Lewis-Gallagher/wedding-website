            They first met in 2015, during their work as research assistants for the cancer genome project in Cambridge. Lewis worked on growing cells and Niki then processed them to extract the DNA, not the most romantic origin storyâ€¦
            <br><br>
            Amidst the long hours of pipetting and to dull the aching of their thumbs, the two would spend time chatting and discovered they both had mutual music tastes and were particularly fond of a certain artist named Frank Turner. They developed a firm friendship and spent many movie nights, evenings out and gigs together, even as friends they were off on adventures together.
            <br><br>
            In 2017 Niki decided to leave the lab for pastures new and begin teacher training. While Lewis left to pursue a career in bioinformatics - fatefully, both paths converged on Leicester.
            <br><br>
            Out of friendship a fondness grew and in 2018, during the one cold Janurary night, Niki bravely plucked up the courage to tell Lewis her true feelings of endearment. Luckily, Lewis felt the same way and, after confessing his feelings, promptly ran out of the car! The two then settled on a first date later in the week in the snowy avenues of Leicester and have been inseparable since. 
            <br><br>
            It took several years before they could see that they belonged together (a few friends have claimed they spotted their connection well before even Niki and Lewis did!) Their love story may not have begun with a bright spark but rather blossomed, slowly, and purposefully, into a fire that continues to burn with an unwavering earnestness which has led them to their wedding day in 2024. 
            <br><br>
            We are so excited to celebrate our love with you and hope to see you all very soon.
            <br><br>
            Niki & Lewis.
